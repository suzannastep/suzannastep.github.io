I am a PhD candidate in the [Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago. 

Perhaps better known as Sue.

## Research interests

Deep learning, neural networks, numerical analysis, and more generally analysis of algorithms for data science. 

My projects have included:
- Depth separation of neural networks in terms of learning capabilities
- Representation costs of deep neural networks
- Detecting branching structure in data
- Eigenvalue methods for multivariate numerical rootfinding
