I am a PhD candidate in the [Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago graduating in June 2026. 

**I am currently on the job market looking for a postdoc.**

## Research interests

Deep learning, neural networks, optimization, and more generally analysis of algorithms for data science. 

My projects have included:
- Analyzing neural networks adapt to structure in data when trained gradient descent
- Depth separation of neural networks in terms of learning capabilities
- Representation costs of deep neural networks
- Effect of linear layers in neural networks
- Eigenvalue methods for multivariate numerical rootfinding
