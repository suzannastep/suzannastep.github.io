About me
======
I am a PhD student in the [Committee on Computational and Applied Mathematics](https://cam.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago. Perhaps better known as Sue. :)

Research interests
======
Deep learning, optimization, numerical analysis, and more generally analysis of algorithms for data science. 

My projects have included:
- Representation costs of deep neural networks
- Detecting branching structure in data
- Eigenvalue methods for multivariate numerical rootfinding
