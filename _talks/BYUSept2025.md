Abstract:
Machine learning methods are increasingly used to solve inverse problems, wherein a signal must be estimated from few measurements generated via a known acquisition procedure. While approaches based on neural networks perform well empirically, they have limited theoretical guarantees. Specifically, it is unclear whether neural networks can reliably take advantage of low-dimensional structure shared by signals of interest --- thus facilitating recovery in settings where the signal dimension far exceeds the number of available measurements. In this talk, I will present a positive resolution to this question for the special case of underdetermined linear inverse problems. I will show that, when trained with standard techniques and without explicit guidance, deep linear neural networks automatically adapt to underlying low-dimensional structure in the data, resulting in improved robustness against noise. These results shed light on how neural networks generalize well in practice by naturally capturing hidden patterns in data.
